Zero takes place starting in November 2010 in the Beta Attractor Field outside of the Steins Gate. It depicts the Rintarou Okabe who had given up on saving Kurisu Makise after his first horrific failed attempt. Caught in despair, Okabe abandons his "Hououin Kyouma" persona and is tormented by flashbacks of Kurisu's death and the incidents of the Alpha world lines. The Labmems are worried about him, and at Mayuri's recommendation he begins treatment at a mental health clinic.

His life is stirred up again when, while helping out at a university seminar, he meets Kurisu's professor and research supervisor, Alexis Leskinen, along with Leskinen's assistant, Hiyajo Maho. Kurisu had worked in the same lab as them at Victor Chondria University studying artificial intelligence. From them Okabe learns about the "Amadeus" system, which stores the memory of a human and creates an emulation of that person. His life is changed completely when Leskinen asks Okabe to become a "tester" in interacting with Amadeus and Okabe meets Kurisu's "Memories" held within the system.

As a tester Okabe continues to speak with "Kurisu" using a dedicated smartphone application. As their conversations pile up, like in the past Okabe begins to grow closer. However, Okabe is also filled with anguish.

Other plot points include, the labmems hold Christmas and New Year's celebrations to hearten and cheer Okabe up. The girls dress as Santa Claus and shrine maidens and attention is given to the story of Amane Yuki and Daru and their future daughter Suzuha.

Also, while the Labmems are all gathered, a mysterious masked group bearing firearms attacks the lab, and Okabe is struck by the recollection of Mayuri's many deaths in the Alpha world lines. This is a world line where the PhoneWave no longer exists, and there should be no other reason for SERN to target them, but...

Though it will draw from the Epigraph Trilogy light novels and the stories from various drama CDs, Zero is not a "game-ification" of those stories but will have its own new scenario. Characters not seen in the original visual novel and anime will also be joining the cast, such as Hiyajo Maho, Amane Yuki, Shiina Kagari; Fubuki (Katsumi Nakase) and Kaede Kurushima, Mayuri's cosplay friends; Alexis Leskinen; and Judy Reyes, a professor of physiological psychology.
